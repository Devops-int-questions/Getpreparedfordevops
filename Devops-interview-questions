Ans:
First one , you can follow terraform documentation and get started, use the aws provider, and follow the aws_instance documentation, to get started , you will find a sample example as a reference. 

Ans:
For second one, you can follow the ansible documentation, search for yum module or apt module, depending on OS you choose if it is redhat or Ubuntu. it is straightforward, look for module examples, you will get all the required steps.

Tip - if you know the manual steps, you need to just find relevant module and order in which you need to execute those steps with ansible. 

Ans:
Regarding Packer - it is used to build or create images, provided by hashicorp,  if you are comfortable with terraform, you can find syntax for packer similar to the terraform. Once the images are created using Packer, you can use that AMI wtih the terraform to create a VM. 
Sequence of steps would be:

2. Use that image with terraform and create the EC2 instance
3. Install nginx webserver on EC2 instance.
