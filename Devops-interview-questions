Ans:
First one , you can follow terraform documentation and get started, use the aws provider, and follow the aws_instance documentation, to get started , you will find a sample example as a reference. 

Ans:
For second one, you can follow the ansible documentation, search for yum module or apt module, depending on OS you choose if it is redhat or Ubuntu. it is straightforward, look for module examples, you will get all the required steps.

Tip - if you know the manual steps, you need to just find relevant module and order in which you need to execute those steps with ansible. 

Ans:
Regarding Packer - it is used to build or create images, provided by hashicorp,  if you are comfortable with terraform, you can find syntax for packer similar to the terraform. Once the images are created using Packer, you can use that AMI wtih the terraform to create a VM. 
Sequence of steps would be:

282. What happens if your state file is accidentally deleted?
Answer: Terraform loses track of all managed infrastructure. On next apply, it will attempt to recreate everything from scratch, 
potentially causing conflicts with existing resources.
283. What happens if multiple team members run terraform apply simultaneously?
Answer: State file locking fails, risking corrupted state and inconsistent infrastructure. One process succeeds while others error out, 
potentially leading to drift if not managed properly.
284. What happens if a resource fails halfway through a terraform apply?
Answer: Terraform leaves successfully created resources running but marks the state as tainted. 
Subsequent apply operations will attempt to recreate failed resources, but you're left in partial state.
285. What happens when AWS API rate limits are hit during a large terraform apply?
Answer: Operations fail with throttling errors. Terraform retries a few times then fails the apply. 
Resources created before the limit was hit remain, creating partial deployments.
286. What happens if terraform plan shows no changes but infrastructure was modified outside Terraform?
Answer: Terraform won't detect the drift until you run terraform refresh or terraform plan -refresh-only. 
This can lead to unexpected behavior when making future changes.
287. What happens if you delete a resource definition from your configuration?
Answer: On next apply, Terraform will destroy that resource in your infrastructure unless you use terraform state rm
to remove it from state first or use lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }.
288. What happens if a provider API changes between Terraform versions?
Answer: You may encounter compatibility issues and failed plans/applies. 
Resources might need to be rebuilt or configurations updated to match new API requirements.
289.  What happens if you have circular dependencies in your Terraform modules?
Answer: Terraform will fail to initialize or plan with dependency cycle errors. 
You'll need to refactor your module structure to break the circular references.
290. What happens if you exceed AWS service quotas during deployment?
Answer: Resources will fail to create with quota exceeded errors. 
Terraform marks them as failed, and you'll need to request quota increases before retrying the apply.
291. What happens if you lose access to the remote backend storing your state?
Answer: All Terraform operations fail until access is restored. 
Teams can't collaborate, and changes can't be applied safely. This effectively blocks all infrastructure changes.
